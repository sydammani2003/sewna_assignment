I have tried to restructure the whole Welcome page from the scratch and I have given a feature for the customers i.e for those who need designers.

Q. Why you chose that feature?
A. Because I myself as a customer when I go to a shopping mall, I will try to eliminate all the floors not related to Men's section as I don't find my desired outfit in other floors as I being a men. Similary when a customer is looking for a designer he don't want to wander around portfolios of all designers but instead he will be looking that particular designer who will be able to match the designs that he is desiring. So when someone clicks on "I need a designer" there I have given feature of filtering out the design types and occasions. Based on these filters only the designers working in these types of designs there profiles will be popped up.

Q. What you wanted users to feel or experience?
A. For Designers - I wanted them to add their portfolios in the sewna very easy and efficient. And more over they can communicate with their customers very efficiently.

For Customers - Though everything works here virtual and at the end they will get the outfit. But throughout their journey with the designers I want to create a strong and trustworthy connection between them.
